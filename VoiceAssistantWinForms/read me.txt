Alright, let me guide you through using me effectively. To interact, simply use voice commands. In this version, the available commands are limited to: 'Can you find in Google', 'open program', 'Stop recognition', 'Settings', and 'Close Settings'.

When you say 'Can you find in Google', you can follow up with your search query, and I'll open Google to find it for you.

For 'open', just mention the name of the program. But remember, you need to add the program to your settings first.

To access 'Settings', simply say the word, and the settings form will pop up. Here, you can adjust various configurations to suit your preferences.

To close the settings form, just say 'Close Settings'.

Lastly, 'Stop recognition' is used to exit the program altogether.
